# detox-expo

We need to download a built version of the Expo iOS app that Detox can use to hook into. Go to the Expo Tools page and click the “Download IPA” link. Expand the downloaded archive, then change the name of the folder to “Exponent.app”. Create a bin folder in your project and move “Exponent.app” into it.
